Commercial statement listing a set of products and services (in our case line items) to be purchased by the customer from shop owner for a defined price. Once the quote is created the price of the line items must not change automatically anymore ([audit-proof]()). This should only happen manually by an authorized users. When adding products to the quote a line item is created and the information from the product is copied from the product to the line item.
