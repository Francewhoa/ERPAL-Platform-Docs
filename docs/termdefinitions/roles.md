- **ERPAL User:** The person using ERPAL. For example an accountant creating invoice, a shop owner selling products, a developer working on projects
- **ERPAL Admin:** The person setting up ERPAL to be usable by the user. The admin can add product types, taxonomy terms, tax rates 
    etc.
- **Self Customer:** The person that buys stuff on his own from a webshop by going through the whole cart process. He will then interact with ERPAL/the shop himself.
- **External Customer:** Something can be sold to him. In this case he will not interact with ERPAL himself, but only the ERPAL user who is in charge of the sales process.
