### Adding youtube videos
To add youtube-videos to a documentation-page please insert them as an iframe with the `youtube-iframe` class.
this way the width is flexible and the videos should be shown properly.

for example:

    <iframe class="youtube-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A5rx_UoQXf8"></iframe>
